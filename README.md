This repository is home to a wide range of Simulation related files.<br/>
From scripts for analysis to figure-generation scripts and everything in between, this repo has the files pertaining to the work produced and in production by the Molecular Simulation Laboratory at Universidad de Valpara√≠so.

The files are sorted by program to which they relate, and/or to the project that made them necessary. This, respectively, mainly has to do with whether we are talking about an analysis or a plotting script.
